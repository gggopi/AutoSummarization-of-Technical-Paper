<h3>Introduction</h3>
It is difficult to introduce both novice and experienced procedural
programmers to the anthropomorphic perspective necessary for
object-oriented design. We introduce CRC cards, which characterize
objects by class name, responsibilities, and collaborators, as a
way of giving learners a direct experience of objects. We have
found this approach successful in teaching novice programmers the
concepts of objects, and in introducing experienced programmers to
complicated existing designs.
<h3><a name="problem">1. Problem</a></h3>
The most difficult problem in teaching object- oriented programming
is getting the learner to give up the global knowledge of control
that is possible with procedural programs, and rely on the local
knowledge of objects to accomplish their tasks. Novice designs are
littered with regressions to global thinking: gratuitous global
variables, unnecessary pointers, and inappropriate reliance on the
implementation of other objects.
<p>Because learning about objects requires such a shift in overall
approach, teaching objects reduces to teaching the design of
objects. We focus on design whether we are teaching basic concepts
to novices or the subtleties of a complicated design to experienced
object programmers.</p>
<p>Rather than try to make object design as much like procedural
design as possible, we have found that the most effective way of
teaching the idiomatic way of thinking with objects is to immerse
the learner in the "object-ness" of the material. To do this we
must remove as much familiar material as possible, expecting that
details such as syntax and programming environment operation will
be picked up quickly enough once the fundamentals have been
thoroughly understood.</p>
<p>It is in this context that we will describe our perspective on
object design, its concrete manifestation, CRC (for Class,
Responsibility, and Collaboration) cards, and our experience using
these cards to teach both the fundamentals and subtleties of
thinking with objects.</p>
<h3><a name="perspective">2. Perspective</a></h3>
Procedural designs can be characterized at an abstract level as
having processes, data flows, and data stores <a href=
"#references">[1]</a>, regardless of implementation language or
operating environment. We wished to come up with a similar set of
fundamental principles for object designs. We settled on three
dimensions which identify the role of an object in a design: class
name, responsibilities, and collaborators.
<p>The class name of an object creates a vocabulary for discussing
a design. Indeed, many people have remarked that object design has
more in common with language design than with procedural program
design. We urge learners (and spend considerable time ourselves
while designing) to find just the right set of words to describe
our objects, a set that is internally consistent and evocative in
the context of the larger design environment.</p>
<p>Responsibilities identify problems to be solved. The solutions
will exist in many versions and refinements. A responsibility
serves as a handle for discussing potential solutions. The
responsibilities of an object are expressed by a handful of short
verb phrases, each containing an active verb. The more that can be
expressed by these phrases, the more powerful and concise the
design. Again, searching for just the right words is a valuable use
of time while designing.</p>
<p>One of the distinguishing features of object design is that no
object is an island. All objects stand in relationship to others,
on whom they rely for services and control. The last dimension we
use in characterizing object designs is the collaborators of an
object. We name as collaborators objects which will send or be sent
messages in the course of satisfying responsibilities.
Collaboration is not necessarily a symmetric relation. For example
in Smalltalk- 80 <a href="#references">[2]</a>, View and Controller
operate as near equals (see example below) while OrderedCollection
offers a service with little regard or even awareness of its
client.</p>
<p>Throughout this paper we deliberately blur the distinction
between classes and instances. This informality is not as confusing
as it might seem because the concreteness of our method substitutes
for naming of instances. This also makes our method for teaching
independent of whether a class or prototype-based language is
used.</p>
<h3><a name="cards">3. CRC Cards</a></h3>
The second author invented CRC cards in response to a need to
document collaborative design decisions. The cards started as a
HyperCard <a href="#references">[3]</a> stack which provided
automatic indexing to collaborators, but were moved to their
current form to address problems of portability and system
independence.
<p>Like our earlier work in documenting the collaboration of
objects <a href="#references">[4]</a>, CRC cards explicitly
represent multiple objects simultaneously. However, rather than
simply tracing the details of a collaboration in the form of
message sending, CRC cards place the designer's focus on the
motivation for collaboration by representing (potentially) many
messages as a phrase of English text.</p>
<p><img src="fig1.gif"><br>
<i>Figure 1. A Class-Responsibility-collaborator (CRC) index
card</i></p>
<p>As we currently use them, all the information for an object is
written on a 4" x 6" index card. These have the advantages that
they are cheap, portable, readily available, and familiar. Figure 1
shows an idealized card. The class name appears underlined in the
upper-left hand corner, a bullet- list of responsibilities appears
under it in the left two-thirds of the card, and the list of
collaborators appears in the right third.</p>
<p><img src="fig2.gif"><br>
<i>Figure 2. CRC-cards describing the responsibilities and
collaborations of Smalltalk's Model, View and Controller.</i></p>
<p>Figure 2 shows an example taken from the Smalltalk-80 image, the
much-misunderstood model-view-controller user interface framework.
We have deliberately shown only a portion of the responsibilities
each of these objects assumes for clarity of exposition. Note that
the cards are placed such that View and Controller are overlapping
(implying close collaboration) and placed above Model (implying
supervision.) We find these and other informal groupings aid in
comprehending a design. Parts, for example, are often arranged
below the whole. Likewise, refinements of an abstraction can be
collected and handled as a single pile of cards with the most
abstract card on top where it can represent the rest.</p>
<p>The ability to quickly organize and spatially address index
cards proves most valuable when a design is incomplete or poorly
understood. We have watched designers repeatedly refer to a card
they intended to write by pointing to where they will put it when
completed.</p>
<p>Design with the cards tends to progress from knowns to unknowns,
as opposed to top-down or bottom up. We have observed two teams
arriving at essentially the same design through nearly opposite
sequences, one starting with device drivers, the other with
high-level models. The problem demanded a certain set of
capabilities which both teams discovered in the course of
fulfilling the requirements of the design.</p>
<p>We suggest driving a design toward completion with the aid of
execution scenarios. We start with only one or two obvious cards
and start playing "what-if". If the situation calls for a
responsibility not already covered by one of the objects we either
add the responsibility to one of the objects, or create a new
object to address that responsibility. If one of the object becomes
too cluttered during this process we copy the information on its
card to a new card, searching for more concise and powerful ways of
saying what the object does. If it is not possible to shrink the
information further, but the object is still too complex, we create
a new object to assume some of the responsibilities.</p>
<p>We encourage learners to pick up the card whose role they are
assuming while "executing" a scenario. It is not unusual to see a
designer with a card in each hand, waving them about, making a
strong identification with the objects while describing their
collaboration.</p>
<p>We stress the importance of creating objects not to meet
mythical future needs, but only under the demands of the moment.
This ensures that a design contains only as much information as the
designer has directly experienced, and avoids premature complexity.
Working in teams helps here because a concerned designer can
influence team members by suggesting scenarios aimed specifically
at suspected weaknesses or omissions.</p>
<h3><a name="experience">4. Experience</a></h3>
One of the contexts in which we have used CRC cards is a three-hour
class entitled "Thinking with Objects," which is intended for
computing professionals who have programmed, but whose jobs do not
necessarily involve programming every day. The class proceeds by
introducing a data flow example (a school, with processes for
teaching and administration) which is then recast in terms of
objects with responsibilities and collaborators (such as Teacher,
Janitor, and Principal). The class then pairs off and spends an
hour designing the objects in an automatic banking machine, an
exercise chosen because of everyone's familiarity with the
application and its ready breakdown into objects to control the
devices, communicate with the central bank database, and control
the user interface. (See the appendix for a sample solution.) The
exercise is followed by a definition of the terms "class",
"instance", "method", and "message", and the class concludes with a
brief discussion of the history and features of a variety of
object- oriented programming languages.
<p>In teaching over a hundred students this course we have
encountered no one who was unable to complete the exercise unaided,
although one pair in each class usually needs a few hints to get
started. Although we have done no follow-up studies, the class is
considered a valuable resource in the company and is still well
attended with a long waiting list almost a year after its
inception.</p>
<p>We have also asked skilled object programmers to try using CRC
cards. Our personal experience suggests a role for cards in
software engineering though we cannot yet claim a complete
methodology (others <a href="#references">[5][6]</a> have more
fully developed methodologies that can take advantage of CRC
methods). We- know of one case where finished cards were delivered
to a client as (partial) design documentation. Although the team
that produced the cards was quite happy with the design, the
recipient was unable to make sense of the cards out of context.</p>
<p>Another experiment illustrates the importance of the context
established by the handling and discussing of cards. We had
videotaped experienced designers working out a problem similar to
the bank machine. Our camera placement made cards and the
designers' hands visible but not the writing on the cards. Viewers
of the tape had no trouble following the development and often
asked that the tape be stopped so that they could express their
opinions. The most telling moments came when a viewer's explanation
required that he point to a blurry card in the frozen image on the
screen.</p>
<p>Finally, we have used CRC cards to advantage in explaining
complex designs. A few minutes of introduction is sufficient to
prepare an audience for a card based presentation. Cards can be
made out in advance or written on the spot. The latter allows the
complexity in a design to be revealed slowly, a process related to
Dave Thomas' "lie management". The cards are being used as props to
aid the telling of a story of computation. The cards allow its
telling without recourse to programming language syntax or
idiom.</p>
<h3><a name="conclusion">5. Conclusion</a></h3>
Taking our perspective as a base we give novices and experienced
programmers a learning experience which teaches them something
valuable about objects. CRC cards give the learner who has never
encountered objects a physical understanding of object-ness, and
prepares them to understand the vocabulary and details of
particular languages. CRC cards also give useful and convincing
experience with objects to those who has learned the mechanisms of
objects but do not yet see their value.
<p>Ragu Raghavan <a href="#references">[7]</a> has said that in the
switch to objects strong programmers become stronger, but weaker
programmers are left behind. Using the cards in group settings we
found that even weaker programmers, without a deep understanding of
objects, could contribute to object designs. We speculate that
because the designs are so much more concrete, and the logical
relationship between objects explicit, it is easier to understand,
evaluate, and modify a design.</p>
<p>We were surprised at the value of physically moving the cards
around. When learners pick up an object they seem to more readily
identify with it, and are prepared to deal with the remainder of
the design from its perspective. It is the value of this physical
interaction that has led us to resist a computerization of the
cards.</p>
<p>It is just this problem-integrating the cards with larger design
methodologies and with particular language environments, that we
feel holds the most promise for the future. The need to retain the
value of physical interaction points to the need for a new kind of
user interface and programming environment as far beyond what we
have today as our current systems are beyond the tool-oriented
environments of the past.</p>

<h3><a name="appendix">Appendix</a></h3>
Here we provide a sample solution to the banking machine problem
discussed in section 4.
<p>Account and Transaction provide the banking model. Note that
Transaction assumes an active role while money is being dispensed
and a passive role thereafter.</p>
<p><img src="fig3.gif"></p>
<p>Transactions meet their responsibilities with the aid of several
objects that serve as device drivers. The Dispenser object, for
example, ultimately operates the dispensing device.</p>
<p>The CardReader object reads and decodes the information on the
bank card's magnetic strip. A common mistake would be to itemize
all of the information stored on the bank card. Card encoding
formats must certainly be well thought out and documented. However,
for the purpose of designing the objects, we need only identify
where that knowledge will be placed in the program.</p>
<p><img src="fig4.gif"></p>
<p>The RemoteDataBase drives the communication lines and interprets
data transmitted across them. It creates Account objects and
consumes Transaction objects.</p>
<p>The device drivers signal exceptional or asynchronous events by
adding Event objects to a shared queue.</p>
<p><img src="fig5.gif"></p>
<p>Events drive the human interface by triggering Actions that
sequence through Screens. The actual format and sequence of screens
will be determined by the user-interface design and will probably
vary from bank to bank. We offer objects from which state-machine
like interfaces can be built.</p>
<p><img src="fig6.gif"></p>
<p>Screen objects correspond to the states and Action objects
correspond to the transitions. Screens may vary in how they
dispatch Actions. Actions themselves will vary in how they process
events. Actions ultimately construct Transactions to which they
delegate the further operating of the bank machine</p>
